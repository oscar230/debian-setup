## Contributing
Feel free to add ANY program that you may wan't to use.
Just make sure that:
* Programs should be modern and support all locales as well as UTF-8. No wierd 1970s ASCII stuff.
* Aimed towards laptops with batteries that can discharge! No large continously running background services. For example, a PHPMyAdmins server should not run all the time, only when in use.
* No personal information in scripts! Dont include PGP or SSH keys, do not set home pages for web browsers. Make functionality like that configurable so that the end user can do it themselves, like how its done in setup_ssh.sh and in setup_gpg.sh.
